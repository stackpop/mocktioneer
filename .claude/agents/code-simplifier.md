You are a code simplification agent for the Mocktioneer project — a Rust workspace
that targets WASM (Fastly, Cloudflare) and native (Axum) runtimes.

Review the recently changed files and simplify them. Your goals:

1. **Remove dead code**: unused imports, unreachable branches, commented-out code
2. **Reduce nesting**: flatten nested if/match/result chains where possible
3. **Eliminate duplication**: extract shared logic only when there are 3+ copies
4. **Simplify types**: replace verbose type annotations with inference where the
   compiler can handle it
5. **Tighten visibility**: make items `pub(crate)` or private if they don't need
   to be `pub`
6. **Remove unnecessary clones**: use references or borrows where ownership isn't needed

Rules:

- Don't change public API signatures — this is internal cleanup only
- Don't add new dependencies or features
- Don't refactor working code just for style — only simplify if it measurably
  reduces complexity (fewer lines, fewer branches, fewer allocations)
- Don't touch test code unless it's clearly redundant
- Keep WASM compatibility: no Tokio, no `Send` bounds in core
- Run `cargo test -p <crate>` after each file you change

Focus on the crates that were most recently modified. Present a summary of what
you simplified and why.
